# Lakes Symbology

*Symbology* refers to the symbols or patterns used to represent your data on the map. The data for the lakes should be visible as polygon shapes on the map - but they'll be in a random colour. This is because QGIS can't possibly know what your data actually is, so when you bring any data in, QGIS assigns it a default symbology with a random colour. Let's change that.

## Visualising the Data

Right click on the WFD_LakeSegment layer in the Layers panel, and choose Properties. In the Properties window, choose Symbology on the left.

Click on the coloured Color bar to open the Select Color window.

Choose an appropriate colour for the lakes, and click OK twice to close the Select Color and Properties windows.

Save the project before continuing.
