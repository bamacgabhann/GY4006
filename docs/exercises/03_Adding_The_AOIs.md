# 03: Areas of Interest (AOIs)

The module project, for which you were given the research question, aims, and objectives, is looking at fluvial (river) flooding in Ireland. However, all of Ireland would be too much to ask you to analyse. So, for these exercises, each of you will be focusing on a separate area of the map. I have created a file with one feature for every person in the class, individually labelled. You'll have to download this file, and then find and extract your own AOI from it.

## Adding the Data

Your AOI (Area Of Interest) is contained in a file named ```GY4006_Areas.gpkg```, which can be downloaded from the Week 9 section of the Brightspace site for GY4006. Download this file.  Move the downloaded ```GY4006_Areas.gpkg``` file to your GY4006 folder. 

Go back to QGIS and look at the Browser panel. Find the ```GY4006_Areas.gpkg``` file in the GY4006 folder, and drag it from the Browser panel to the map canvas to add it to the project.
  
Save the project again (```Project > Save```, or click the 'save' icon, or use keyboard shortcut ```Ctrl-S```).
