# Your AOI

Your AOI should now be visible on the map as a separate polygon shape. However, it’s a solid block of colour – which isn’t much good if you want to see what’s in your area, because it's covering everything. We need to change how it’s displayed. Ideally, we want it to be an outline, with no colour fill, so that we can see where it is, but not obscure anything inside the area.

## Visualising the Data

Right click on your AOI layer and choose Properties and Symbology, then click on Simple Fill. 

Click the dropdown arrow for Fill style, and choose No brush. If you wish, you can also adjust the Stroke colour, Stroke width, and other elements here. Click OK when done to close the Symbology window.

Now you should be able to see the data within your area. Right click on your AOI layer in the Layers panel, and choose Zoom To Layer to zoom in on your area.

Save the project before continuing.
