# GY4006: GIS and Geospatial Data Analysis

Welcome to the supporting materials for the geospatial / GIS component of module GY4006.

## Part 1 - Notebooks

The first part of this component of the module involves using some Python code in Jupyter Notebooks to familiarise yourself with the key concepts in working with geospatial data and GIS. Don't worry - you don't need to write, or even understand the Python code itself! It's all pre-written; we're just using this because it makes it a bit more interactive. You don't need to install anything either, because it's all run online on Google Colab - so all you need is a Google account, and you can open it on any internet connected device. A phone might be a bit small, though!

There's 10 Notebooks to work through. The first is just a written introduction - the other 9 contain code cells to run as well as the explanatory text.

## Part 2 - GIS Exercise / Assignment

At the start of the module, you were given a Research Question plus Aims and Objectives:

**Research Question**  
What vulnerabilities to fluvial flooding exist in Ireland?

**Aims**  
To inform future flood hazard mitigation planning

**Objectives**  
What is peopleâ€™s experience of fluvial flooding in Ireland?  
Is there a socioeconomic bias to who is vulnerable to fluvial flooding in Ireland?  
When is fluvial flooding most likely to occur in Ireland?  
Where is fluvial flooding most likely to occur in Ireland, and what is vulnerable there?  

You have addressed some of this in the survey task; we can now address the remainder through some mapping.

You will be assigned an individual area to work on. Everyone will be undertaking the same mapping, but on your own areas. So, you should be able to help each other out.

In order to address your objectives and help to answer the research questions, you're going to make some maps of your area - and analyse some of that map data. 

The point of this exercise - which will ultimately produce a portfolio of maps for your second assessment - is to introduce you to geospatial analysis, to show you some of what's possible using geospatial analysis, and to show you that you can do some geospatial analysis. Now, I understand that not everyone has the same targets in college - some of you want to get a top grade, while others might just be looking to get a C and pass. That's fine and entirely up to you - and so the way I've constructed this exercise / assessment breaks it down into different levels of tasks depending on what grade you are aiming to achieve.

You should by now have gone through the 10 Notebooks, and have some idea of the difference between vector Point, Line, and Polygon data, attribute data, and raster data. You should also have some idea of vector and raster geoprocessing, and of the potential for changing the symbology of the data, i.e. how the data is visualised.

To get a passing grade in the module, you will have to use all of these to some extent - and to get a B-grade or A-grade, you'll have to go into greater depth or detail.

The instructions here are broken down by what grade you're aiming for. [You can find the instructions here](./exercises/start.md).
