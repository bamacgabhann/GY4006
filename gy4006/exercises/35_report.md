# 35: Report ```[C-grades and above]```
___
Congratulations - you have finished the mapping tasks. Hopefully this has given you a good insight into what's possible with GIS.

However, simply creating maps is not enough - we also need to be able to interpret and explain what our maps show.

At the start of the module, you were given a Research Question plus Aims and Objectives:

**Research Question**  
What vulnerabilities to fluvial flooding exist in Ireland?

**Aims**  
To inform future flood hazard mitigation planning

**Objectives**  
What is peopleâ€™s experience of fluvial flooding in Ireland?  
Is there a socioeconomic bias to who is vulnerable to fluvial flooding in Ireland?  
When is fluvial flooding most likely to occur in Ireland?  
Where is fluvial flooding most likely to occur in Ireland, and what is vulnerable there?  

You addressed some of this in the survey task; you have now addressed others through the mapping exercises. It's time to explain this in your report.

## Interpreting and Explaining the Data
___
Your report should describe and explain what your mapping shows to address each of the relevant objectives, and how it contributes to answering the research question.

- It should explain *where* in your area flooding might happen: describing and referring to your mapped the flood risk areas and the water levels used to map them (explaining why those water levels were used).
- It should describe *what* is in those flood risk areas: referring to your base map and your satellite data to describe the land use, and any features present in the areas.
- It should discuss *who* is vulnerable: specifically explaining whether your census thematic maps show any *socioeconomic differences* between people living in your flood risk areas, and people living elsewhere in your area.
- Finally, it should combine these together (perhaps along with some elements from your survey) to briefly summarise the contribution to answering the research question of what vulnerabilities to fluvial flooding exist in Ireland.

Your report should make direct reference to each of the maps which you will submit. 

## Grading
___

Your choice of which tasks to complete determines your maximum possible grade. Within this maximum, your grade will be determined by:

- The degree to which you have successfully completed the tasks.
- The appropriateness of your choices, e.g. colours and symbols, the second calculated census data attribute.
- The presentation of your submitted map layout PDFs.
- The degree to which your report demonstrates your ability to use and analyse mapped data.


## Submission
___

Submit your report and PDF maps through the Assignment link on Brightspace.
