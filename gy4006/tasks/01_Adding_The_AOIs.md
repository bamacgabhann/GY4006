<h1>Areas of Interest (AOIs)</h1>

The module project, for which you were given the research question, aims, and objectives, is looking at fluvial (river) flooding in Ireland. However, all of Ireland would be too much to ask you to analyse. So, for these exercises, each of you will be focusing on a separate area of the map. I have created a file with one feature for every person in the class, individually labelled. You'll have to download this file, and then find and extract your own AOI from it.

<h2>Adding the Data</h2>

Your AOI (Area Of Interest) is contained in a file named GY4006_Areas.gpkg, which can be downloaded from the Week 9 section of the Brightspace site for GY4006. Download this file. You should create a folder called GY4006 in your UL OneDrive (*please do this; in previous years, I've had too many people lose days or weeks of work because they saved everything to the Downloads folder of a UL PC, which gets cleaned and erased regularly; or in their home folder on a laptop which broke, and some other similar issues - you can avoid any risk of this if you use OneDrive). Move the downloaded GY4006_Areas.gpkg file to your GY4006 folder. 

Go back to QGIS and look at the Browser panel. It lists the files and folders on your computer (and below that, connections to database and web servers; we arenâ€™t using these connections right now). In the file tree, if you click the arrow beside a drive or folder it will expand to show the contents. Expand the file tree to find your GY4006 folder (Home folder then OneDrive). Right click on the folder and choose Add as a Favourite to make the folder easier to find in future. Once you've done this, find the GY4006_Areas.gpkg file in the GY4006 folder, and drag it from the Browser panel to the map canvas to add it to the project.
  
Before doing anything else, you should save the project. From the menu, choose Project > Save As. Navigate to your GY4006 GIS folder, and type a filename e.g. IrelandFlooding. Click Save.
