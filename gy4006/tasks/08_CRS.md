<h1>Coordinate Reference Systems in QGIS</h1>

The main topic of this week’s lecture is different map projections and co-ordinate reference systems (using the example of the Irish Grid and ITM). Some of you will be doing this before the lecture, and will unfortunately have to wait for that to understand it more fully, but the main point is that the Earth is not flat, it’s round, and it is not easy to show a round surface as a flat map. There’s several different ways of doing it, and they produce results which can be very different from each other. 
There’s also many different co-ordinate systems: the global GNSS (GPS) system uses latitude and longitude, but those are measured in degrees, and how long is a degree? They’re tricky to use locally if you’re interested in calculating distances, areas etc. Instead, many countries have defined their own national grids, usually with co-ordinates measured in metres – which is much more intuitive. 
Now is the point we have to consider this in QGIS. Ideally, you want your map to be using one system, and all your layers to have coordinates using the same system. 
Hover the cursor over the OPW layer, in the Layers panel. You’ll see a popup appear, which contains the text “OPW (Point – EPSG:4326)” and the location of the file. 
“Point” tells you that the file contains vector point data. EPSG codes are codes for co-ordinate reference systems (CRS) – so the data for this layer is saved in co-ordinate reference system EPSG:4326. This is the WGS84 global latitude-longitude co-ordinate reference system, which is used by the GNSS (GPS) system.
Now hover the cursor over WATER_RivNetRoutes in the Layers panel. You’ll see the popup with “WATER_RivNetRoutes (MultiLineString – EPSG:29902)”. MultiLineString tells you this is vector line data, with multiple lines. This CRS is the old 1965 Irish Grid – why the EPA is still using this, I have no idea; someone needs to tell them the 90s called and want their co-ordinate system back.
Finally, if you hover over GY4006 Areas in the Layers panel, the popup will be “GY4006 Areas (MultiPolygon – EPSG:2157)”. MultiPolygon should be obvious now – vector polygons, with multiple polygons. This CRS is the current Irish Transverse Mercator (ITM) co-ordinate system which is the current standard system for mapping in Ireland. This is the CRS we want to use throughout the project.
Now look at the bottom right corner of the screen – you should see EPSG:29902 listed there. This is the Project CRS – the co-ordinate reference system used in the Map Canvas. It’s currently set to the 1965 Irish grid, because that’s the CRS used by the first data we added. 
The Layer CRS is what projection the file is saved in. The Project CRS is how the map is drawn in the map canvas. 
I want to demonstrate how big a difference the Project CRS can make. So, from Sulis, download the files Albers ESRI102013.gpkg, Lambert ETRS89.gpkg, and Plate Carree EPSG32662.gpkg from Sulis, and add them to your map. Each of these layers is named for the map projection they’re saved in.
Now, zoom out until you can see the whole of Europe. One by one, right click on each layer in the Layers panel, and choose Set CRS > Set Project CRS From Layer. You’ll see the map on screen change, quite significantly in some cases. Notice particularly how Ireland looks each time. (If you want to play around with this more, and look at different projections, doubleclick on the EPSG code in the bottom right corner of the screen to open the Project CRS options.)
Since we’re working on data just from Ireland, the CRS we want to use is ITM, Irish Transverse Mercator, EPSG:2157. This is easy to do, since we have a layer using ITM. Set the project CRS from GY4006 Areas in the Layers panel. Ireland will be a bit zoomed out now, so right click on the rivers layer, and choose Zoom to Layer to zoom back in.
You may noticed that when changing the project CRS, although the data looks different, the relative positions of all the different data stays the same. This is because QGIS does something called projecting on the fly – if data is imported in a CRS different to the project CRS, it reprojects it to the project CRS for display on the screen. This is fine for just looking at data. However, it’s really intensive, so if your computer seems to be getting slower, that’s probably why. For any data processing, we would ideally have to reproject (resave) all the data into one CRS. We won’t do this just yet, but will be doing some of that later. Save the project before continuing.
